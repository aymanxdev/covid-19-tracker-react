  <p align="center">
    A COVID-19 app 🦠 built from scratch utilising ReactJS, Material UI, a free API to get data, interactive graphs and an amazing free map API. I have also used to Context API to easily access the variables on a Global state and have better organisation as well as doing my best to achieve better OOP. This application also include an easy to switch dark theme. 👨‍💻
